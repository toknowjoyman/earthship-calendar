# earthship-calendar
an elaboration of the Human Calendar, accounting for Leap phenomena and lunar phases, as an intuitive way to introduce future generations to spaceship earth. *Work-in-Progress*

The Human Calendar
-
Designed by Scott Flansburg, and described in his words, it has "365 days divided into 13 months of 28 days each and the first day of the year is the Zero Day. The 13 months are numbered 0-12. Every month has 4 weeks. Every date falls on the same day of the week every month. "

# Issues to be addressed

- Lunar syncing will be off because of zer0-day whether we use a 28 day lunar cycle or 27.3
    - *to verify:* the actuality of 27.3 days of human experienced lunar cycle.
    - no point trying to numerically balance solar and lunar cycles, im sure this has been tried for 1000's of years. We will allow these to fluctuate a little, if they balance eventually, s.t. newcomers are able to question and understand the astro-purpose.
    
- Leap years would an extra 0 day, a 00 day ;) every 4 years, while following the 100 & 400 yr pattern from the greggy calendar. 

*other astronimics to include*
-
north star and/or southern cross
eclipse schedules
solar zeniths *what is the deviation, is there a grace period, etc.?*
